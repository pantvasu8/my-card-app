You can check for filters or debug if needed after uncommenting console statements which I have written on cardList.js file inside src folder.

#### You can try out these filters:

1. Type

â€‹		Subscription or Burner

2. Cardholder

   Here I have provided two cardholders select any of them.

   ##### Try with only Type, only cardholder or both filters to see different results you can try search also with these filters.
